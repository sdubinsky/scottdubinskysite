    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-me-text">
        <p>I'm an oleh chadash originally from Pittsburgh currently residing in Netanya.  I have a double degree in Computer Science and Linguistics from the University of Maryland, College Park.  I specialize in natural language processing and systems integration, although I have a good grounding in a wide variety of programming subfields.  I prefer functional designs for my programs, both because I find it the easiest to intuit and because it works well for a number of linguistic applications.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm a competitive fencer.  You can read more about that <a href="/fencing">here</a>.</p>
        <p>You can find the code for this site <a href="githubcom/sdubinsky">on my github</a>.</p>
