    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-me-text">
        <p>I'm an oleh chadash originally from Pittsburgh.  I have a double degree in Computer Science and Linguistics from the University of Maryland, College Park.  I specialize in natural language processing and systems integration, although I have a good grounding in a wide variety of programming subfields.  I prefer functional designs for my programs, both because I find it the easiest to intuit and because it works well for a number of linguistic applications.  I also run <a href="http://titlereader.com">Title Reader</a>.  Go check it out if you have a messy bookshelf.</p>
        <p>You can find the code for this site <a href="https://github.com/sdubinsky" target="_blank">on my github</a>.</p>
