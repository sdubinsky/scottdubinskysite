<p>I am a competitive epee fencer currently fencing out of Kfar Saba.  I learned to fence at the University of Maryland, and subsequently spent several years at DC Fencer's Club being coached by Ilya Lobanenkov.  Post-graduation, I also spent two years volunteer coaching at the UMD fencing club.</p>
<p> I also make highlight reels, which can be found <a href="http://youtube.com/scottdubinsky">here.</a></p>
